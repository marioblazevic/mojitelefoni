# My second website

In this website i used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT with JQUERY, and JSON.

Unlike the previous website i made, in this i used AJAX to load products from json file. I wanted that part to be dinamic.

There is also client side validatation for registering users, but just for practice. In next project i included database for real registration.

You can also display products by categories.
